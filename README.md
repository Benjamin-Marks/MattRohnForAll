Installation
----------------------
To add this chrome extension:

2. Download the source code
3. Open [The chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions)

At this time there is no way to disable the extension or hide the content but show the comments. I might add that later, but the capitalistic pressures of the world may force me to make it subscriber exclusive extension content
